In this video, we will focus on men with low testosterone
--andropause
Symptoms of low testosterone are fatigue, muscle loss, low sex drive
Additional symptoms mentioned are brain fog, lack of motivation, erectile dysfunction
Conventional medicine will diagnose low testosterone at 250-300
Normal testosterone levels in young males are 600-1000
If a male has testosterone of 400 the conventional doctor will say that is normal
Improving lifestyle can increase testosterone to 600
Stress
Diet
High insulin can cause the deposition of belly fat
Too much estrogen can cause belly fat
Estrogen can drive sex hormone-binding globulin
Hypothyroidism can cause low T and low sex drive
Lifestyle must be addressed before supplementing with T
Sleep, stress, exercise, and diet must come first
Meditation
--14-15 an ad try to remove it
A case story of a recent patient who was already taking testosterone
I performed a Dutch hormone test, found the patient was an over aromatizer, and his SHBG was elevated
I prescribed anastrozole, an aromatase inhibitor
I also prescribed a peptide CJC-1297 [CJC-1295] and ipamorelin to help lose fat
Mark Hyman uses natural ways to prevent excess estrogen such as diindolylmethane
In this case, Dr. Papanicolaou used anastrozole instead of diindolylmethane to get faster results
Diindolylmethane is a compound derived from the digestion of indole-3-carbinol, found in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli
Calcium glucarate can also be used to increase the metabolism of estrogen
Men can regain a huge amount of vitality with T supplementation
Always monitor estrogen and sex hormone binding globulin with people on T s

10% of men under the age of 40 have erectile dysfunction
There is a 60% chance of erectile dysfunction by the time you're 70
Endothelial dysfunction is a key part of what causes erectile dysfunction 
That means there is a hardening of the arteries in the penis
Viagra only addresses the end problem but ignores all underlying issues
Insulin resistance is connected to endothelial dysfunction 
When the endothelial cells aren't working then the nitrous oxide is not going to have an impact
The first sign of heart disease is probably having trouble getting an erection
--alcohol
--revascularization is like angioplasty for the penis
--T might help ED
Sleep apnea, excess alcohol, diabetes, stress will affect T
Pre-diabetes and insulin resistance is the biggest reason for low T
The more belly fat you have the lower your testosterone
Alcohol is a problem because it increases a hormone converter called aromatase which is an enzyme that converts testosterone into estrogen 
--Eat good healthy fat

--dr p the matrix
--mercury lead impacting endothelial mitochondrial function
First I focus on their diet, an inflammatory diet because anything that causes inflammation will damage the blood vessel lyings and can affect blood flow

Next, I look at insulin resistance and pre-diabetes
Must test oral glucose tolerance with insulin
--I look at adrenal stress on test
--we use NMR, oxidative LDL, CRP
--we do 4 point cortisol test
--I think he does a dutch test
--some men are natural aromitizers
A case story of a patient, a fasting glucose tolerance test showed insulin at 40 at 1 and 2 hours
--A1C was 5.6, 5.8 is prediabetic, I told the patient you are pre-diabetic
When patients hear the word insulin resistance they don't know what that is, but when they hear the word diabetes they know what that is
I purposely say pre-diabetic and all of a sudden I have leverage
We take out sugars, processed foods, gluten, dairy, alcohol, soy
I want you to have established a good stress management program I'll get even more specific and say I want you meditating
Add fish oil, vitamin D, adrenal adaptogens
After 9 months the patient was much better
--T came up to 450

, $$When labs show low B12 despite adequate intake that is probably because the person is not absorbing it well.
You can absorb 3 mcg B12 at one time, that is one ounce of liver.
Passive absorption is weaker than active absorption
The intestines reset every few hours at which time a person can get another dose
Do not eat liver at every meal, can overdose copper and vitamin A
Serum B12 15% up or down compared to last labs is normal
The most infamous b12 absorption issue is pernicious anemia
Pernicious anemia is an autoimmune attack on cells in the stomach that make intrinsic factor, which is a protein needed to absorb B12
The rate of pernicious anemia in society is 0.1%, but after age 60 then 1.9%
15%-40% of older adults lower absorption from subclinical gastritis
H Pylori can cause this, 50% have this, even if no symptoms
Do not lay down after taking medications, can harm the stomach
The RDA for adults is 2.4 μg/day of vitamin B12
Take 40 mcg/day dose if impaired absorption, but passive absorption intact
600 mcg/day should cover the needs for most but not all with pernicious anemia
1000mcg/day if covering the needs of all with PA
1000mcg to 3000 is probably not harmful
Better to not take a higher dose if not needed
High doses of micronutrients that are not needed are possibly not good for the microbiome
Lab level of B12 400 is the minimum we should have
Measure methylmalonic acid to verify
If no absorption problem then beef liver capsules are ok
B12 injections not needed, oral B12 is effective, even for pernicious anemia
If vegan not confident in nori seaweed or mushroom are adequate, must test to monitor
If serum is high B12 and supplementing B12 then it that is ok
If serum is high B12 and not supplementing then check blood liver and kidney health

Insulin resistance is the heart of type 2 diabetes
Type 2 diabetes/Insulin resistance causes most or is associated with most of the diseases such as heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, etc.
Diabetes is a disease with two phases
First, there is a long slow phase where the blood glucose rises very slowly and that's where the insulin resistance is rising 
During this time the body produces enough insulin to overcome this resistance so the blood glucose stays relatively normal
This is called compensatory hyperinsulinemia
Eventually, the pancreas doesn't produce sufficient insulin, the blood glucose goes up, type 2 diabetes is diagnosed
The diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is late in the game
Up to 14 years before the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes there is rising insulin resistance
--219 great graph
Fatty Liver precedes type 2 diabetes
ALT is a marker of liver damage
Fatty liver is the key to understanding insulin resistance 
Excess dietary starch, glucose, and fructose, not fat, can cause fatty liver
Fructose is metabolized solely in the liver which turns it into fat
Weight loss surgery can cure diabetes
Fasting can give the same effect as weight loss surgery
As the pancreatic fat decreases, the beta cells recover
The idea that type 2 diabetes is chronic and irreversible is completely untrue
Insulin resistance is an overflow paradigm
Insulin is the wrong treatment
Mediations to lower blood glucose do not make people healthier
If your body has too much sugar then do not put more in
How to reverse type 2 diabetes:
    1. Don't put more in - a low carb diet
    2. Burn it off - Intermittent fasting

    5. Hemoglobin falls /*Hemoglobin is a protein in your red blood cells that carries oxygen to your body's organs and tissues and transports carbon dioxide from your organs and tissues back to your lungs.*/
    6. MCV falls /*MCV is the average size of your red blood cells*/
Inadequate absorption can include:
    Poor biovailability
    Antacids or high gastric pH
    Dietary bran, phytates, competition from other metals
    Loss of absorbtive enterocytes
    Celiac disease
    Inflamitory bowel disease
Iron deficiency is often a sign of underlying pathology
Iron deficiency in post menoposul woman or adult male is due to GI blood loss until proven otherwise
That means it is colon cancer until ruled out.  To not know this is malpractice.
Iron deficiency is not necessarily anemia
Iron deficiency is associated with fatigue in non-anemic individuals
There was a trial of women with fatigue, not anemic, ferritin < 50, hemoglobin average 12.4
    There was no benefit
    But those women with ferritin 15 or less then there was a significant benefit
Fatigue is due to low iron, even in the absence of anemica
Patient history may include 
    Restless legs
    Wounds slow to heal
    Pagophagia (compulsive ice chewing) and forms of pica
    Painful tongue
    Brittle hair and hair loss
    Cracking at corners of mouth
    Spooning nails
Workup
    Serum iron
    Total iron binding capacity (TIBC is a functional test for transferrin)  Do not order transferrin.
    Ferritin
    Soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR)
Transferrin is the major iron transport protein
/*Transferrin is minimally affected by acute inflamation, but with time the serum transferrin...*/
Transferrin saturation is the serum iron divided by the TIBC
Transferrin saturation can change because of inflamation
Functional iron deficiency occurs when the percent transferrin saturation falls to 15-20%, even if patient has iron stores
Can be confusing to physician if patient has both inflation and iron deficiency
By itself, transferrin saturation is not diagnostic of iron deficiency anemia because it takes a constelation of lab findings
Ferritin is produced mostly by liver cells, functions as an iron storage protein, and has no transport function
A patient with iron overload due to hemochromatosis can be treated with therapeutic phlebotomies
If serum iron < 12-15 ng/mL that is iron deficiency, which is different than anemia
If serum iron 15 - 200 ng/mL possible iron deficiency depending on clinical circumstances
Serum iron is an acute phase reactant, might not reflect iron stores, so look at all data and clinical history
Treatment of iron deficiency assumes the cause is known
Oral iron supplements will often suffice
Parenteral iron required if:
    Patient not compliant
    GI side effects (seen in 15-20% of patients)
    Patient cannot absorb oral iron
    Rapid reversal is required
    Ongoing losses exceed absorptive capacity
Meat is the only food that can provide significant iron
Iron in meat is heme iron, which is much more efficiently aborbed
Oral replacement guidelines:
    Try to give 100mg of elemental iron daily
    Take in between meals on an empty stomach
    Less expensive forms generally work as well as more expensive forms
    Newer forms such as Proferrin have absorbtive advantages but are more expensive
Iron is absorbed mostly at the first part of the small intestines /*so rectal supository I assume wont work*/
Iron absorbtion can be tested with an oral iron absorption test
    Give two tablets of iron on an empty stomach or with orange/lemon juice
    Measure serum iron at baseline and at 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 minutes
    Serum iron should increase by at least 100 mcg/dL
A 32 year old woman had chronic fatigue and mild anemia, no GI symptons
    An oral iron absorbtin test showed she could not absorb iron
    Based on that finding alone she underwent an upper endoscopy and small bowel biopsy which confirmed celiac disease
There are five forms of FDA approved parental iron
Safety profiles are good for the newer IV iron but none are 100% risk free
Goals of Treatment
    Correct the anemia
    Provide enough iron to raise iron stores (monitored by serum ferritin)
    Follow the serum ferritin to assess iron balance
    Give enough additional iron to prevent recurrent iron deficiency
When patient is told their hemoglobin is normal but continue oral iron 3-4 months the patient often does not comply

The first common pattern is insufficiency dysbiosis
90% of the beneficial bacteria are Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes
The second common pattern is inflammatory dysbiosis
Balance in the microbiome does not mean the complete elimination of all harmful microbes
balance means there are enough beneficial microbes to keep the harmful microbes in check
A small number of harmful microbes can have some beneficial functions
Certain pathogens should be completely gone, but the opportunists are not a problem at low levels
Bacteroides species prevent the colonization of harmful microbes by producing the short-chain fatty acid propionate
Primary causes of dysbiosis
    Pathogens
    Drugs (antibiotics, PPIs, etc)
    Poor diet
    Digestive & immune dysfunction
    Toxins
Giardia generally is a harmful microbe, but just because a particular microbe is present, doesn't necessarily mean it is causing a problem.  The effect depends on each person's microbiome.
--42:00 he says klebsiella is detected but I don't see it
--Giardia often produce all patterns, digestive problem
Elastase-1 range states >200 ug/g, the patient value of 302 is not flagged as low but is below optimal of 500
Steatocrit measure of fat malabsorbtio
Giardia is known to cause intestinal permeability, so it will be seen with high anti-gliadin IgA
Zonulin high can be seen with Giardia
The third common pattern is digestive dysfunction dysbiosis
This is caused by low stomach acid, insufficient bile acids, poor digestion (pancreatic insufficiency or brush border enzyme deficiency), reduced absorption and altered GI motility.
Pathogens can be caused by low stomach acid
H pylori is known to cause hypochlorhydria in most people that have it
Digestive dysfunction can cause overfeeding of good bacteria so they will be overgrown
Enterococcus and Streptococcus can overgrow if stomach acid is low
In the section Phyla Microbiota, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes can be overgrown can be caused by excess food components that are not digested and absorbed properly.  This can also be associated with SIBO.
Prevotella copri tends to benefit from undigested carbohydrates
Can't overemphasize how important optimizing digestion is
Prebiotics can help promote balance in the microbiome
Inulin can help promote the butyrate-producing bacteria
Glucomannan can help promote Bacteroidetes
If these beneficial bacteria are low then these prebiotic are something to consider
Probiotics have been shown to be helpful
Saccharomyces Boulardii has a lot of research behind it for balancing the microbiome
Colostrum has a lot of research beyond it for low Secretory IgA, promoting intestinal barrier and balancing the microbiome
SBI Immunoglobins is a nondairy version of immunoglobins
Glutamine and zinc carnosine can help mucosal gut health and reduce leaky gut
Polyphenols have been shown in several studies to balance the microbiome
Polyphenols inhibit pathogenic bacteria and stimulate beneficial bacteria
Nutritional deficiencies such as zinc can affect the production of stomach acid and other processes
Vitamin A and D deficiency are well known to have effects at the mucosal barrier
To increase Firmicutes which are the butyrate producers increase prebiotics such as resistant starch and inulin
For Bacteroidetes they can do well on starches or glucomannan, increase protein in the diet, improve mucous of the gut lining
Anti-inflammatory diet and supplements
Polyphenols are helpful
If a significant imbalance in the microbiome then antimicrobial might be needed
Candida is inflammatory
Th17 cells are inflammatory

The patients parathyroid level was low so that was not the problem
The patient was taking vitamin D 5k per day, serum vitamin d level was in the 80s
The patient stopped taking vitamin D and all symptoms resolved
The ideal range of vitamin D should be 30 to mid-50s

Parathyroid glands keep calcium in a proper range
General fatigue and malaise are the main symptoms because of calciums effect on nerves
High parathyroid is usually because of a tumor
High serum calcium means calcium is leaving the bones which can cause osteoporosis
If adult then calcium should be in 9s
The conventional lab range of calcium is too wide
If calcium is over 10 and over age 40 then could be a problem
If calcium is higher then parathyroid should be lower, they are opposite
If calcium is higher and parathyroid high normal that could be a problem
Vitamin D controlled trials we do not see big benefits but might play a role with infections

Hyperparathyroidism is not rare
This may not show up on common blood screening
Symptoms are fatigue, digestive issues, anxiety, muscle aches
Serum calcium is not related to the nutritional status of calcium
Calcitonin is a perk of natural desiccated thyroid
The correct serum level of calcium is essential for health
If serum calcium is high then test parathyroid hormone.
If calcium is normal or high and if the parathyroid hormone is high then the patient might have parathyroid disease
High serum calcium is always significant and should not be ignored, even if just a little high, even if one time.
High serum calcium could be kidney disease or cancer.
The preceding information is primary hyperparathyroidism
/*Secondary hyperparathyroidism could mean kidney failure or calcium or vitamin D deficiency*/
A little less than 1% of the population has primary hyperparathyroidism
The cause of hyperparathyroidism is not known
Symptoms are kidney stones, gallstones, bone pain, bone fractures, feeling tired, do not feel well, GI symptoms, IBS heartburn, ulcers, constipation, frequent urination and thirst, anxiety, brain fog, difficulty concentrating
If calcium is 9.8 or above then test parathyroid hormone
If calcium 9.9 and parathyroid is elevated this could still be parathyroid disease
If on the high side of calcium then should be on the low side of parathyroid hormone
If both calcium and parathyroid are high then something is wrong, review with the parathyroid surgeon
Select a surgeon that does a large amount of these surgeries
